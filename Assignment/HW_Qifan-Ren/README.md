2 vis results is
- a clustered scatter plot based on PCA.
- a parallel coordinates plot.

Both of them can highlight the element in one class when mouse on.

The dataset is the dry bean dataset: https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/602/dry+bean+dataset

I tried to optimize but unfortunately the interactive visualization with full data is still jammed, so I chose to randomly sampled 1000 entities every time.
