## Description
In this assignment, I chose to use image data named Mnist for visualization.
## Interactive Graph(left part)
I implemented a Lineplot graph with axis x representing digits from 0 to 9, and axis y representing performance(0.00~1.00) to visualize the predicted report of the SVM model.

I provided labels for each axe and the title of the graph.

For the interaction part, I set up an input text for users to input a gamma value, and It will invoke the backend interface with inputted value as a parameter to impact the SVM model prediction.

## Right part
I use a scatterplot to visualize the result the t-SNE algorithm with two components.
Above the figure, the legend with numbers in unique colors indicates the corresponding spots scattering in the graph.
